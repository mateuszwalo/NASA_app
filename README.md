# ü™ê NASA Machine Learning App

Welcome to the NASA Machine Learning App! This application enables you to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predict potential threats to Earth using various machine learning models. Built with Streamlit, it provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore and analyze data related to Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze data to gain insights into NEOs.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle imbalanced data using SMOTE and standardize features for better model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Get detailed evaluation metrics and visualize model performance with ROC curves and AUC scores.

## Installation
